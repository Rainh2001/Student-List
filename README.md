# Student-List
This is a model studeny entry database which holds essential student information including first-name, last-name, average mark, dob, and gender.
This project was initially created as an example for building an array of records (in this case array of objects). This is coded in pure JavaScript.

### What I learned:

1. Creating select and option elements and defining their values and text values through JavaScript.
2. Resetting text boxes value and select element's chosen option.
3. .selectedIndex method for select elements.
4. .disabled method for button and option elements.
5. Selected attribute for option elements.
6. Higher understanding of scope in regards to let (block scope), var (global scope, can be hoisted), and const (global scope, cannot be re-assigned).
